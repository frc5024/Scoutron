# Scoutron
A program to scan a bubble sheet and automatically upload the data to a Google Spreadsheet

GOAL: The goal of this program is to streamline the inputting of scouting data. So instead of having a human read the sheets and type in the data for every record, they only have to take a picture of a bubble sheet and run the program.
